<h1>'May be detained': US travel update issued amid toughened border security</h1>
<div class="relative -top-1"><span>By</span> <span><a data-testid="author-link" class="text-blue-600 hover:opacity-30" href="/profile/635/sarah-falson/">Sarah Falson</a></span></div>
<p>Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has issued a travel update for the US including advice for Australia's LGBTQIA+ community amid reports of toughened border security measures.

DFAT's Smartraveller website states entry requirements are strict and travellers may be detained if entry is denied.


"US authorities have broad powers to decide if you're eligible to enter and may determine that you are inadmissible for any reason under US law," the update says.

"Check US entry, transit and exit requirements. Whether you're travelling on a visa or under the Visa Waiver Program, ensure you understand all relevant terms and conditions before attempting to enter the United States."

The update includes new advice about sex indicated on passports.

"Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country," the advice says.

The update advised travellers to contact the nearest United States Embassy or Consulate before they travel for further information.


It comes as reports circulate of individuals being denied entry into the US and their devices being inspected.

There have also been reports out of Europe that several European countries have updated their travel guidance for transgender and nonbinary travellers.

Australia's DFAT still advises travellers to exercise normal safety precautions in the USA.

DFAT's current USA Travel Advice includes advice that:

entry requirements to the USA are strict and US authorities have broad powers to decide if foreign nationals can enter
if entry is denied by border authorities, a traveller may be detained.
US officials may ask to inspect travellers' electronic devices, emails, text messages or social media accounts. If a traveller refuses, officials can deny entry.
US authorities actively pursue, detain and deport people who are in the country illegally.
it is common for US authorities to carry out random travel document checks, including on public transport, and Australians should be prepared to show these documents.
Meanwhile, Australian citizens visiting for less than 90 days may be eligible to apply for an Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) and enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP).

"If not, you'll need to get a visa before you travel," says Smartraveller.

"Whether you're travelling on a visa or under the VWP, ensure that you understand all relevant terms and conditions before attempting to enter the US."</p>
